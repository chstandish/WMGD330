<div class="about-blurb">
    <p class="about">Founded 11 years ago, The Spiral Bookcase is more an idea than anything else. Spiral thrives on all things strange and unusual, whether that's stories from just off the beaten path or tales told from the clutches of otherworldly creatures. Form and shape of these stories matter less than intention and content, and we aim to hold space for marginalized voices. 

        We consider our shop a haven for those with stranger souls and wilder minds. The Spiral Bookcase does not tolerate racism, sexism, classism, transphobia, homophobia, xenophobia or othering of any kind. 
        
        At The Spiral Bookcase, we aim to be an active, uplifting member of the community. To help do so, we offer books on wellness, sociology and witchcraft on a sliding scale of cost to the BIPOC (Black, Indigenous & people of color) members of our community. Folks can name their price from $0 to the wholesale cost of the book at checkout and pay what they wish.
